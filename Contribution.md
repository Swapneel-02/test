### Getting Started

1.  If you are new to Git and GitHub, it is advisable that you go through
    [GitHub For Beginners](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/)
    **before** moving to Step 2.

2.  Fork the project on GitHub.
    [Help Guide to Fork a Repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo/).

    ![Illustration for How to Fork a Repository](https://hisham.hm/img/posts/github-fork.png)

3.  Clone the project.
    [Help Guide to Clone a Repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)

4.  Create a branch specific to the issue you are working on.

    ```shell
    git checkout -b update-readme-file
    ```

    For clarity, name
    your branch `update-xxx` or `fix-xxx`. The `xxx` is a short
    description of the changes you're making. Examples include `update-readme` or
    `fix-typo-on-contribution-md`.

5.  Open up the project in your favorite text editor, select the file you want
    to contribute to, and make your changes.

    If you are making changes to the `README.md` file, you would need to have
    Markdown knowledge. Visit
    [here to read about GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
    and
    [here to practice](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

    *   If you are adding a new project/organization to the README, make sure
        it's listed in alphabetical order.
    *   If you are adding a new organization, make sure you add an organization
        label to the organization name. This would help distinguish projects
        from organizations.

6.  Add your modified
    files to Git, [How to Add, Commit, Push, and Go](http://readwrite.com/2013/10/02/github-for-beginners-part-2/).

    ```shell
    git add path/to/filename.ext
    ```

    You can also add all unstaged files using:

    ```shell
    git add .
    ```

    **Note:** using a `git add .` will automatically add all files. You can do a
    `git status` to see your changes, but do it **before** `git add`.

6.  Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message.

    ```shell
    git commit -m "Brief Description of Commit"
    ```

7.  Push your commits to your GitHub Fork:

    ```shell
    git push -u origin branch-name
    ```

8.  Submit a pull request.

    Within GitHub, visit this main repository and you should see a banner
    suggesting that you make a pull request. While you're writing up the pull
    request, you can add `Closes #XXX` in the message body where `#XXX` is the
    issue you're fixing. Therefore, an example would be `Closes #42` would close issue
    `#42`.

### Submitting a Pull Request

[What is a Pull Request?](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/)

If you decide to fix an issue, it's advisable to check the comment thread to see if there's somebody already working on a fix. If no one is working on it, kindly leave a comment stating that you intend to work on it. By doing that,
other people don't accidentally duplicate your effort.

In a situation where somebody decides to fix an issue but doesn't follow up
for a particular period of time, say 2-3 weeks, it's acceptable to still pick
up the issue but make sure that you leave a comment.

*Note*: Every open-source project has a **CONTRIBUTING.md** file, please make
sure to read this before you open up a pull request; otherwise, it may be
rejected. However, if you do not see any CONTRIBUTING.md file, you can send a
pull request but do it in a descriptive manner.

### Adding to the Main README

The
[main `README.md` file](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/how-to-contribute-to-open-source/blob/master/README.md)
contains a list of useful resources for beginners who want to contribute to
open source.

You can contribute to this page by adding a Markdown-formatted link.

It should look similar to the one below.

```
- [Title of the page](www.websitename.com/slug-name-here) - Add a description of why I should look at this site
```

When in doubt, take a look at the current list of items to get an idea of how you should format your contribution.

When adding your contribution to the list, please add your link to the most appropriate section. If you are unsure, feel free to ask in your pull request or comment in an issue asking for guidance.

### Adding to Non-English README

The main `README.md` file is written in English. That file will be the template for all of the other languages.

This repository is about contributing to open source and generally, translation is important to reach diverse audiences. It is recommended that you provide language-specific resources links instead of the English-resource links.

The non-English README files are named `README-XX.md`, where `xx` is the
[two letter language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)
for the language.

You can contribute to the non-English README files by taking links that are in the English README but are not in the language of your choosing. When making a pull request with these changes, please tag someone who can verify your language contribution by adding `@` in front of their GitHub username to the pull request.

If your language does not exist yet, feel free to start it yourself. If you decide to do this, please add more than just the title. If you do not have the time to create one, feel free to
[create an issue](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/how-to-contribute-to-open-source/issues/new/choose)
to crowdsource help.

# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at {{ email }}. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
